## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
I tried to add a table that held employee information. I also tried to add five input fields and add them to the table when they were filled out but struggled with that. I also tried to remove fields when an employee was removed. The final thing I tried to do was add up the total salary for all employees and display that on the page. I struggled but asked questions throughout the weekend and chatted with my classmates. I'm trying to really understand the information so that's why this assignment and a few of my past assignements have been incomplete because I'm reading books, watching youtube videos and it just isn't sticking. I'm a little concerend because I want to be helpful when major group projects start. I'll be up early Monday to push some more commits but it's been none stop reading and watching and I still don't feel confident.
